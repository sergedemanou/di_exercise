# Exercise 2 : Dogs Domesticated
# Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# Create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# Add the attribute trained (boolean) to the PetDog class, should always start False
# Add the following methods:
# train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True
# play: gets parameter of any amount of other dogs (look up args) and prints “the dogs: dog_names play together” each of the dogs that plays has their trained boolean switched to False
# do_a_trick: will print one of the following sentences randomly ONLY IF the dogs trained boolean is True, after doing the trick the trained boolean moves to False
# “dog_name does a barrel roll”
# “dog_name stands on their back legs”
# “dog_name shakes your hand”
# “dog_name plays dead”
